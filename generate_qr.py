qr_path = "portfolio_qr_named.png"      # your generated QR code
output_path = "NKETIA_JEFFRED_CV_withQR.pdf"  # new CV with QR added

# === Step 2: Create a temporary overlay PDF with the QR code ===
packet_path = "overlay.pdf"

# === Step 3: Position of QR (x, y in points) ===
# You can adjust these values to move the QR up/down or left/right
x_position = 420  # from left
y_position = 650  # from bottom

# Load and draw the QR code
qr_image = ImageReader(qr_path)
c.drawImage(qr_image, x_position, y_position, width=120, height=120, mask='auto')
